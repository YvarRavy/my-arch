## How to setup arch

note: this setup only works for uefi based bios if you use legacy this probaly won't work for you.
you can also set up uefi with encryption but i won't use that

1. download iso from [here](https://archlinux.org/download/)
2. mount iso on usb or cd for this i used [rufus](https://rufus.ie)
3. restart device and go into boot loader and startup device using the usb/disk
4. using fdisk -l to see the disk you want to use for your arch
5. i'm using my hdd for this
6. create 3 partitions
    1. test
    2. test
    3. test
